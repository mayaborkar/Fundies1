# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the brackets with
the point count.

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]
Yes

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]
This assignment took 2 hours.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. **Please explicitly state (yes or no)** whether you attended any
office hours, and mention any TAs who were especially helpful._ [1 point]

I worked with Rhea on this whole assignment. We did pair programming on this assignment and took turns typing.
Before each of the questions we discussed and planned which functional programming function we should use and how to
implement it and then the first half of the assignment she typed in our answer and on the second half, I typed in
our answer. Often times we had to debug so we discussed how to do that as well.

### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._ [1 point]

We did not use AI.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful_ [1 point]

The only main resource that we used on this assignment was the IntelliJ tips. The main thing that we had trouble
on was knowing the return types of the functional programming functions. For example, it would return a list of
Mobs when we were supposed to be returning a list of Strings. We used the IntelliJ error messages to see what the
error was, so we could alter our code to do what we needed it to.

## Functional Programming

### What do you think of functional programming?

_What do you like or dislike about it? Had you used it before? Would you like to
use it again?_ [3 points]

I have never used functional programming before. I lke it because it is a very short way of writing the same code.
That being said, I think it is a very different thought process in trying to figure out what you actually want to do.
All of these problems now need to be seen as one of the properties of functional programming, which is very different
than using for loops and such. But, it is a very helpful in that what would normally takes several lines of code now
only takes 2 or 3.

### Debugging

_What was your debugging process like? For example, did you use the debugger or
print statements? Did the tests help you find bugs?_ [2 points]

The main way that we debugged was through the error messages that were provided. I used the print statements to ensure
everything worked in the end. Since this was a new topic to us, most of the errors that we got were syntax errors. In
that the function was returning the wrong type so the error messages very quickly pointed us to the place that this was
happening and we were able to resolve the issue.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of this assignment was definitely changing my thinking process. Before, I would try to solve
all of these problems with for loops and in the beginning that is what my brain tried to replicate. For this homework
assignment, it would be completely different because I had to fundamentally change the way I had to approach the
problem. This time it was more about the information I needed to extract from the data. Also knowing the different
functions we had to work with took a bit of research and getting used to.

The most rewarding part of this assignment was when we got the "All tests passed" message. It was nice because
I was working with Rhea so we were able to bounce ideas off of each other, but at the same time we could celebrate
together when we did get each of the functions working. I learnt a completely new way to program that I have never
encountered before. It is very helpful to make the code shorter and a different way of thinking so it was very helpful
to me.
