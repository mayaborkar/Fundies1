# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the brackets with
the point count.

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]

Yes

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

This assignment took about 3-4 hours, most of it was spent trying to think of what I should do.
Writing the code was not as hard as interpreting the instructions.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. **Please explicitly state (yes or no)** whether you attended any
office hours, and mention any TAs who were especially helpful._ [1 point]

I worked with Rhea on most of this assignment. We discussed almost every single question and
how we should go about writing the code. The hardest part for me was the recolor rectangle and
so I asked Tim. He helped me understand what the process of actually understanding the code. Most
of the people I worked with, I discussed the logic of what I had to do.

### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._

I used the AI to help me debug, for example I asked the syntax of making a subclass and a parent
function in Kotlin because I was getting some errors on that.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which
tools you used and how you used them._ [1 point]

I used most of the tools in order to debug. Otherwise, If I needed help I just discussed with
either Rhea or Tim. I also got some errors with my gradle and so I used stack overflow (linked)

## Mondrian Painter

_What was your addition?_ [1 point]

_May we share your pictures with the class if we especially like them?
If so, should we use your name or keep it private?_ [1 point]

I made my function randomly select a color from randomly selecting a RGB number. This was what
I put in my override function. In my main function I only had a few already written colors and
so there were more options for this. Yes! You may sure, but I'd prefer to keep it private.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of this assignment was definitely trying to figure out exactly what was
being asked of us. I had to interpret what the code wanted us to do, and then break down the
problem further so that it was easier to solve. This was the hardest in recolorRectangle. I had
to research a lot about new functions so I knew how to get an mousetap from the user. It was
hard to know all of the functions that Kotlin had for us to utilize and so that took some research
then I also had to think more about data I needed to capture in order to color the already
created rectangles.

The most rewarding part of this assingment was definitely after I was able to see the visual.
Once, my recolor started working with all of the colors it was really rewarding. It was cool
to see the code directly reacting to my inputs and doing so correctly. This project mostly helped
me learn how to think through each of the individual problems and break them down if I needed to.
It also forced me to get even better at looking up both kotlin functions as well as debugging
the error messages in my code.
