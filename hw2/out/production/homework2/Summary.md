# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the
italicized instructions, as shown in the
[video](https://northeastern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d327c168-e0e8-4f70-9f3f-b12f0048baac).

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, to the best of your knowledge?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not pass._ [1 point]
Some of the Ads were difficult to compile, but I tried to ask for help from the TAs in office hours.

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]
about 10 hours, but separated throughout the week.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 points]

I worked with Rhea Aiyar in the other class to figure out the function. I had the
hardest time with parts 5,6,7 and so I was able to go to online office hours and fix some of the
bugs I had encountered on my problem #5. I also had help from Tim in my class to ensure
my could was right

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which ones were
particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which tools you used and how
you used them._ [2 points]
I looked up on the kotlin database to learn more about nested for loops in order to complete some
parts of the project.

## Thoughts on Targeted Ads

_Write an essay of two or more full paragraphs addressing all the following questions
and justifying your answers._

* What do you think of the targeted ads you receive? Do they seem accurate and helpful?
* How do you feel about your demographics being used for ad targeting?
* What about your health information, location history, browsing behavior, and social
  network?
* Should advertisers be able to include or exclude people based on their demographics,
  health information, browsing behavior, etc.?
* Does it matter if the advertising is for consumer goods or more sensitive areas, such as
  housing or employment opportunities?

These targeted ads are interesting because it helps you indulge in a big way. They are helpful
because they show a lot of the same things that I was previously looking at in that
they show the competition of what is present. In our case we used a persons income, gender, and
age which is really personal info if it was truly used to figure out all of the ads.

If more information would be used, more of the ads would be accurate and work better and this
is what is line that needs to be drawn between how helpful an ad would be and the amount of personal
information that needs to be extracted. I think excluding people based on their browsing is a form
of segregation because they are pushing for a certain ideal which should not be done. It also
leads to people becoming more extreme because very often, people are only shown what interest
them and what they interact with. It does matter because if the decision that has to be made based
on the Ad is more important, then more information might be required in order to give the best
suggestions.

_If you use AI or automated tools (beyond a spell checker) to write your answer, explicitly
disclose your usage._ [5 points]

I did not use any AI tools

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* Did all the tests from the pre-exercise pass the first time they ran?
  (Usually tests don't all pass.) What was the debugging process like?
* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours,
and lecture are always welcome._

My tests did not pass the first time they ran. I needed to ensure all of the bugs were fixed.
There were some problems with my compiler and so I worked on that. I was able to look at the
error messages and back track based on the series of messages that they gave me. It was a bit
interesting because it would often put one of the errors in the place the function was called
and so I used that information to go back to the actual function it was coming from and fix that.
It would also often show 5 error messages, when in reality it was just one error.

It was difficult to know about the nested for loop. Sometimes it was also hard to understand
exactly what was being asked of us, but I was able to ask my friends and the TA's for help
and overcome those obstacles. In this assignment I learned a lot more about when loops and nested
loops. I also learnt a lot more about debugging and finding the mistakes in my code.
