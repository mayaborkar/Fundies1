# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the italicized
instructions and bracketed point counts.

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]

My gradle was not able to start working. I did attend office hours and such, but it still
did not start working. I did try to complete all of the functions to the best of my capability

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

This assignment took about 5 hours over the course of a few days

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 points]

I did attend office hours as well as speaking to a TA online. I worked with Tim and we worked
through some of the functions together. Many of the discussions were about the logistics of the
properties the function should have.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which
tools you used and how you used them._ [2 points]

I did not really use any outside resources for this homework. I did refer to some of the slides
to understand how to manipulate private sets and such. There were a few new topics that needed to
work together and so I had to look through some slides as to how those should work.

## Minecraft

_Give **one or more paragraphs** answering these questions:_

* Have you ever played Minecraft? If so, do you prefer creative or survival
  mode?
* What types of computer games, if any, do you enjoy?
* What addition(s) did you make to the game?
* What were some bugs that you made and fixed?
* For this assignment, you had to work with existing code and documentation.
  Do you enjoy doing that or do you prefer writing everything yourself?
* How do you feel about your progress and understanding?

_There are no wrong (honest) answers._ [5 points]

I used to play minecraft when I was a kid. Previously I would like to play in Creative mode,
because you never had to try and survive. I tried to find as many animals in the wild that I
could. I also liked to build houses without having to worry about dying. Most of the computer
games I enjoyed either were related to animals or to food. One game I liked to play you have to
feed your make believe pet and I use to play many different games that were related to that.

I made some additions to the Chicken class about laying eggs. I had some trouble with setting up
the project, and I went to office hours. I more prefer writing everything myself. Here it was
hard to know exactly what every function did and so it was harder to write the functions that
we had to write. If we had written all our own functions, I think that would have been more
helpful so it would be easier to see the things that we could utilize.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of this assignment was seeing what was already there. I had to go
through all of the classes to see what everything did. It was also understanding the directions.
This is always a hard part for me. While it does get easier, it is still hard. It was also hard
for me to ensure that each of the small elements worked as it was instructed to. This one
was more logic heavy and i felt I had to be a bit more meticulous and so that was the hardest
part for me.

The most rewarding part was seeing a visual represenation of our code and everything that we
changed. It was like the actual minecraft game and so that was cool to see. It was similar to
the enjoyment I got from the wordle game because I was able to relate to the code. I could see
in person something that I spent a lot of time playing, and being able to replicate a small part
of that was cool. I learnt how to interpret the code that was already there. It was really
important in this code to ensure you were utilizing the functions that were already present
because it was able to save a lot of time if you did use them.
