## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work._ [1 point]

Yes

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

This assignment took 5 hours

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 point]

Rhea and I worked together for this whole assignment and pair programmed. We went through each of
the questions together. We first discussed what the problem was actually asking and then we
switched off who wrote the actual code. There were also a few times that we ran into bugs in our program
and then we talked about how to debug and fix our code.

### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._ [1 point]

We did not use AI for this assignment

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful._ [2 points]

The only outside resources that we used was the videos that Ms. Spertus provided for us. We used this
mostly to see how to test our code and understand how our code should actually work.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of this assignment was testing out part 3. Our program kept erroring out and
we were confused as to what was wrong. We tried to use some print statements in order to find out the problems with
our code. But we then referred to the videos that were available to us and then we were able
to find how to accurately test our code. We were unsure exactly how our code was supposed to operate and
this was why it was a bit harder for use to understand what to write. When we watched the video we were
able to figure out how to run our code.

The most rewarding part of this assignment was when we were able to see the visual representation of the
code that we changed. Also when we were able to get the program to run without any errors that was also
rewarding. I learnt how to implement an interface. I also learnt how to make and use subclasses and how
to initialize them. This is also the first time I actually did mutliple inheritance to this extent and this
was very helpful.
